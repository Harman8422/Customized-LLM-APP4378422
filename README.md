An example chatbot using [Gradio](https://gradio.app), [`huggingface_hub`](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/v0.22.2/en/index), and the [Hugging Face Inference API](https://huggingface.co/docs/api-inference/index).
This project is an Extreme Weather Phenomena Analyst chatbot designed to monitor, analyze, and interpret data related to extreme weather events and their potential links to climate change. The chatbot is built using Gradio for the interface and leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to enhance the responses by retrieving relevant documents from a PDF database.
